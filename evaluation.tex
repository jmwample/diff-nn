\section{Evaluation Metrics}

We aim to demonstrate a task agnostic property of this technique by evaluating its effect 
on various models accomplishing disparate tasks. This can include image recognition tasks
such as MNIST or Imagenet, language comprehension tasks such as machine translation or 
text summarization, or tasks in alternative domains such as medical diagnostics or advertising.

We intend to measure the ability of the service provider to invert the fragment of the model 
that the client possesses using maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimators~\cite{fredrikson2015model}, 
variational autoencoders~\cite{doersch2016tutorial}, or other techniques.

To evaluate the efficacy and efficiency of the techniques outlined above we intend to compare
performance of this method on both the client and service provider. Performance elements include
classification delay, operations per second on both user and service provider, network 
load (i.e. size and frequency of communications), and theoretical throughput for a service 
that requires near real time data.
